This directory contains the "CR-SIM" software written in FORTRAN. 

The idea behind CR-SIM is to create an accurate radar forward model operator
 consistent with several CRM microphysics that converts the model variables into the
 form of radar observations and thus to enable the direct comparison between 
 CRM output and radar observations. The CR-SIM can be applied in order to 
 reproduce characteristic (polarimetric) signatures commonly found in 
 (polarimetric) radar observations and examine the performance of different
  microphysical schemes and also to examine the assumptions related to scattering
 characteristics of observed cloud and precipitation systems. 

 The current version of CR-SIM uses input from the following high resolution CRM and
 corresponding microphysical schemes.

 The CR-SIM can be easily configured to work on other models and microphysics schemes. 

The CR-SIM employs the T-matrix method for computation of scattering characteristics
 for cloud water, cloud ice, rain, snow, graupel and hail and allows the specifications
 of the following radar frequencies for scattering calculations: 3 GHz, 5.5 GHz, 9.5 GHz, 
 35 GHz and 94 GHz. 

Given the particles size distributions (explicit or reconstructed from the provided PSD 
 moments),polarimetric radar variables can be calculated if the scattering amplitudes 
 are known. The complex scattering amplitudes are pre-computed and stored as look-up tables
 (LUTs) for equally spaced particle sizes using the Mishchenko's T-matrix code for a non-spherical
 particle at a fixed orientation (Mishchenko, 2000) and for elevation angles from 0째 to 90째
 with a spacing of 1째, for specified radar frequencies, temperatures and different possibilities
 of particles densities and aspect ratios. 

It is worth noting that some particle characteristics needed to simulate polarimetric variables
 such as the shape or the statistical properties of the particle orientations are not explicitly
 specified in the WRF. Thus certain assumptions have to be made, based on much available information
 as possible.  For example, the mean canting angles of all hydrometeors are assumed to be 0째. This
 assumption enables the use of Ryzkov et al. (2010) formulations for computation of polarimetric 
 variables and especially the use of simple expressions for the angular moments, which in turn make
 possible that the width of 2D Gaussian distribution of canting angle that is different for various
 hydrometeor species can be specified. 

The polarimetric variables simulated include reflectivity at vertical and horizontal polarization,
 differential reflectivity, specific differential phase, cross-correlation coefficient,
 specific attenuation at horizontal and vertical polarization, specific differential attenuation, 
 and linear depolarization ratio. Also simulated are the vertical reflectivity weighted velocity,
 mean Doppler velocity and spectrum width. The computation of fall velocities is consistent to the 
 computational method used in the specific microphysical package.
